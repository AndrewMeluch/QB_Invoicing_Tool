# QB_Invoicing_Tool
This is an ultra-lightweight invoicing tool that runs on VBA in an Excel file.  It syncs with QuickBooks but has a number of time-saving features that the QB invoicing tool lacks.

This version of the invoicing tool has been stocked with sample
items for demonstration purposes.  You will need to "Refresh
Items and Customers" before you can export invoices and
estimates to your Quickbooks company file.

In a new invoice, use commas to separate search keywords to
quickly find items.  The item box searches not only the Quickbooks
items but their descriptions.  Hit enter when the desired item is at
the top of the dropdown list to select it.  The primary virtue of this
system is the speed with which you can find items and fill out your
invoice using the enter key, minimal typing, and the arrow keys.  
You can stage the invoice for entry and begin another without 
needing to wait for QuickBooks.

The macros will also remember the quantity entered for an item and
suggest it next time the item is selected.  They also remember the
frequency with which items are invoiced, and will suggest these
higher in the dropdown list for maximum efficiency.
